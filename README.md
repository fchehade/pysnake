`pysnake` is a snake game with a twist. You don't grow in size, but more and more obstacles appear on the screen, making it increasingly harder to catch your food.

This is a little fun side project I started and I quite actually enjoy building and working with.

All of this project is a work-in-progress and subject to change.

Constructive criticism and contributions are well appreciated.
